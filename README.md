INTEREST, acronym for **IN**teractive **T**ool for **E**xploring
**RE**sults from **S**imulation s**T**udies, is an interactive web app
developed using R and [`shiny`](https://shiny.rstudio.com/). It allows
exploring results from simulation studies interactively.

# Live demo

A live demo of INTEREST can be found
[here](https://interest.shinyapps.io/interest/). Please note that this
version is still under active development: bug reports and feature
requests are welcome.

# Installation

INTEREST can be installed locally as a standalone R package, by typing
the following R commands in your R console:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("ellessenne/interest")
```

This requires a working installation of [R](https://www.r-project.org/)
and, preferably, [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/).

# Launch application

To launch INTEREST first load the `interest` R package:

``` r
library(interest)
```

Then, use the `interest()` function:

``` r
interest()
```

The app should now launch in your browser.

# Workflow

![](README_files/sirex-workflow.png)

The workflow of INTERACT is simple:

1.  Load your data and define variables representing point estimates,
    standard errors, methods, and so on;
2.  Performance measures are estimated automatically;
3.  Tables and plots are produced automatically, and can be customised
    and explored interactively;
4.  Tables and plots can be exported for later use.
