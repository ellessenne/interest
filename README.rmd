# INTEREST

INTEREST, acronym for **IN**teractive **T**ool for **E**xploring **RE**sults from **S**imulation s**T**udies, is an interactive web app developed using R and [`shiny`](https://shiny.rstudio.com/). It allows exploring results from simulation studies interactively.

# Installation

INTEREST is shipped as a standalone R package, hosted only on GitHub at the moment.

It can be installed by typing the following R commands in your R console:

```{r gh-installation, eval = FALSE}
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("ellessenne/interest")
```


# Launch application

To launch INTEREST first load the `interest` R package:

```{r load, eval = FALSE}
library(interest)
```

Then, use the `interest()` function:

```{r launch, eval = FALSE}
interest()
```

The app should now launch in your browser.

# Workflow

![](README_files/sirex-workflow.png)

The workflow of INTERACT is simple: 

1. load your data and define variables representing point estimates, standard errors, methods, and so on;
1. summary statistics are computed automatically;
1. tables and plots are produced automatically, and can be customised and explored interactively;
1. tables and plots can be exported for later use.
